This task involves cleaning and processing raw data.

## WHAT I DID

- I have selected the Netflix movies and Tv shows dataset from kaggle and downloaded it.
- I have used python in vs code to clean and prepare the dataset.
- First i have checked for missing values in the dataset, and i found many mssing values. i had two options, to add the missing value or remove the row with the missing value. Since i dont have info to add, i removed the row.
- There were no duplicate elements in my dataset
- Next i tried to standardize the country names.
- In my dataset, the date formate was not correct so i made it to correct format(dd-mm-yyy).
- Column headers where proper so i didnt had to make any changes.
- I have changed few datatypes to its correct format
